## What are Traits?
PHP only supports single inheritance: a child class can inherit only from one single parent.

So, what if a class needs to inherit multiple behaviors? OOP traits solve this problem.

Traits are used to declare methods that can be used in multiple classes. Traits can have methods and abstract methods that can be used in multiple classes, and the methods can have any access modifier (public, private, or protected).

Traits are declared with the trait keyword.

## What are Abstract Classes and Methods?
Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method, but need its child class(es) to fill out the tasks.

An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but not implemented in the code.

An abstract class or method is defined with the abstract keyword.

## What are Interfaces?
Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement.

Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way. When one or more classes use the same interface, it is referred to as "polymorphism".

Interfaces are declared with the interface keyword

## Static Methods
Static methods can be called directly - without creating an instance of the class first.

Static methods are declared with the static keyword:
